          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            I aim to create experiences which are visually and verbally
            significant and highly accessible for a wide range of users. In my
            view, great products find alignment between technical feasibility,
            human needs and viability for the organisation, and this is the
            intersection I am interested in pursuing.
          </p>

            Previously I've worked as a graphic designer to deliver quality
            assets for Wisr and also worked at NSW Health to deliver health
            resources for young people as well as facilitated focus groups and
            webinars for health organisations.

            Outside of this, I'm passionate about food, cooking and exploring a
            city's restaurant scene and love indie video games and 80's horror
            movies.
